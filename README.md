#Mezzomorphic Front End
> Deep Learning Music Generator. 

Mezzomorphic is a web application that uses Rails and Python to generate music via a recurrent neural network.

This is the front end and is used in conjuction with a Rails Api [controller](https://github.com/louiehchen/mezzo_backend) and Mezzomorphic's Recurrent Neural Network [neural network](https://github.com/SudoSanauu/mezzomorphicrnn).


The Mezzomorphic front end is built using Rails 5 and contains the landing page.

*If you don't already have Rails installed you can find installation instructions [here](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html).*
